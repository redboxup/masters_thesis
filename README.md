# Master thesis: Collective Olfactory search using Reinforcement learning
All files,programs and code backup for working on my master's thesis

##Introduction
In nature many organisms use their olfactory senses to detect odor or chemical substances. This helps them in navigating towards or away from the source, this is called chemotaxis. It is essentially motion in response to chemical concentration gradients. Some examples of such phenomena include, sex pheromone trail detection by Lepidotera family or swimming of E. coli bacteria up the concentration gradients of nutrients etc.

To make the model more closely resemble real life, we must also include turbulence in the fluid flow. This is because, turbulence can greatly distort the pheromone signal, therefore a naive search strategy based on sensing the concentration gradients may fail or will be sub-optimal. Thus, here we will introduce reinforcement learning to evolve good search strategies.


## Vicsek model 
This is just code of toy-model to understanding swarming

## Reinforcement learning
Implemented an actor-crtic algorithm for a windy grid world, which is basically a simplified navigation problem

## First update
uploading rest of the relevant files too
